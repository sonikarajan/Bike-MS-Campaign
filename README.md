# Bike-MS-Campaign

Teradata Data Challenge 2018

Bike MS is the National MS Societyâ€™s largest fundraising campaign, engaging over 70,000 participants to raise $68 million in over 75 rides across the country. It is the largest charity cycling series in the United States. After 2012, Bike MS participation and revenue have been on the decline despite a retention rate of over 50%. There are not enough new participants joining the series to reverse the damage caused by attenuation.

The first phase of the project involves applying Big Data and Analytics techniques to better understand and optimize factors that leads to participant attrition and the consequent loss in donation generated.

Tools Used: SAS Enterprise Guide, R, Excel and Tableau
